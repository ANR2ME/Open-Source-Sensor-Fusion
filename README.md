Open-Source-Sensor-Fusion
=========================

The memsindustrygroup/Open-Source-Sensor-Fusion GitHub site is being initially populated (September and October of 2014) in response to an industry partnership, sponsored by MIG, to encourage development of an open source repository of algorithms and datasets for sensor fusion and analytics.  If you are visiting this site prior to the Nov 2014 MEMS Executive Congress, then you are seeing a work in progress.  We will be doing our formal announcement at MEC.   Already, you can see:
* C source library for 3, 6 and 9-axis sensor fusion
* Sensor fusion datasheet which provides an overview of the sensor fusion library capabilities, including electrical and computation metrics
* Sensor fusion user guide
* Basic tutorial information relating to sensor fusion

There is extensive documentation in the associated wiki, which you can access via the toolboar to the right.
